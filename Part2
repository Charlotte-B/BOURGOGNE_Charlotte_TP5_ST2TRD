Part 2

What is the benefit of adding tests here ?

Before changing the code, we need to understand how it works. 
To verify that we won't introduce accidental changes when modifying the code, we need to write unit tests. 
These tests can also identify errors that are already present in the code. 
It also allows you to decide on an improvement strategy before changing the code.
